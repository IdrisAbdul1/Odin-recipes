    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p><strong>Balsamic Vinaigrette</strong> is a tangy, slightly 
        sweet dressing made by combining balsamic vinegar with oil, typically olive oil, 
        and a blend of seasonings. It's a classic choice for <em>salads, roasted vegetables, 
        and marinades</em>, offering a balance of acidity and richness that elevates dishes.</p>

    <p>The base ratio is usually 1 part balsamic vinegar to 3 parts olive oil, but this 
        can be adjusted depending on your preference for tanginess. Common additions 
        include Dijon mustard, garlic, honey or maple syrup (for sweetness), salt, and 
        freshly ground black pepper. The ingredients are whisked or shaken together until 
        emulsified, creating a smooth, pourable dressing.</p>
        
    <p>Balsamic vinaigrette is celebrated for its versatilityâ€”whether drizzled over fresh 
        greens, used as a dip for crusty bread, or brushed onto grilled vegetables, it 
        adds a burst of flavor to any dish.</p>
