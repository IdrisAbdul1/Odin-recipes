    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p><strong>Chia</strong> seed pudding is a <em>creamy</em>, nutrient-packed treat made 
        by soaking chia seeds in liquid, allowing them to absorb and expand into a 
        pudding-like texture. The seeds act as natural thickeners, thanks to their high 
        fiber content, creating a gel-like consistency when mixed with liquids like 
        plant-based milk, fruit juice, or yogurt.</p>

    <p>This dish is incredibly versatile and can be sweetened with natural options like 
        maple syrup, agave, or blended fruit. Popular toppings include fresh berries, 
        sliced bananas, nuts, seeds, granola, or a drizzle of nut butter. Chia seed 
        pudding can be prepared ahead of time, making it a convenient option for 
        breakfast, snacks, or dessert.</p>
        
    <p>Not only is it delicious, but chia seed pudding is also a powerhouse of nutritionâ€”packed 
        with omega-3 fatty acids, protein, fiber, and minerals like calcium and magnesium. 
        It's a wholesome, customizable treat that is as healthy as it is satisfying!</p>

    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>GIn a mixing bowl, combine the chia seeds, almond milk, maple syrup, and vanilla extract.</li>

            bit more almond milk to reach your desired consistency.</li>
